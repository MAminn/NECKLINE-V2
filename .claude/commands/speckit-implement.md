Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists and look for `hooks.before_implement`. Process hooks per the standard hook logic (optional hooks prompt user; mandatory hooks execute before proceeding). Skip silently if no hooks or file missing.

## Outline

1. Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -RequireTasks -IncludeTasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute.

2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
   - For each checklist, count total items, completed items (`- [X]`/`- [x]`), and incomplete items (`- [ ]`)
   - Create a status table:

     ```text
     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |
     ```

   - **If any checklist is incomplete**: Display table, then STOP and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)" — wait for user response.
   - **If all checklists are complete**: Display table and automatically proceed to step 3.

3. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read .specify/memory/constitution.md for governance constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

4. **Project Setup Verification**:
   - Check if git repo: `git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null` → create/verify .gitignore if so
   - Check if Dockerfile* exists → create/verify .dockerignore
   - Check if eslint.config.* or .eslintrc* exists → verify/update ignore patterns
   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore
   - **If ignore file already exists**: Verify essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only
   - **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for Node.js/TypeScript

5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

6. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

7. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

8. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT**: For completed tasks, mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

9. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
   - Report final status with summary of completed work

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit-tasks` first to regenerate the task list.

10. **Check for extension hooks**: After completion validation, check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists and look for `hooks.after_implement`. Process hooks per the standard hook logic. Skip silently if no hooks or file missing.
